# Block Queues

This plugin is using the Flex Plugins API and allows admins and supervisors to filter workers in Team View by what we are calling "voice activities". They are: 

- **waiting**: when the worker is assigned to a voice task but he/she did not accept it yet
- **busy**: in a call
- **warm transfer**: initiated a warm transfer and he/she is in the call
